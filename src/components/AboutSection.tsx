        <p>
        Developer with experience in both consultancy work and product companies.
        Iâ€™m comfortable working across the stack, but I especially enjoy frontend development.
        </p>
        <p>
        My time as a consultant taught me to solve problems flexibly for different clients, while working in a larger product company gave me hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines,
        automated testing, and building maintainable systems at scale.
        I aim to write code that's straightforward to use today and easy to improve tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you're looking for a developer who can adapt to your needs and deliver results, let's talk!
        I'm open to new opportunities and excited to discuss how I could contribute to your team.
