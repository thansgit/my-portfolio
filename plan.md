Cleanup Phase Plan Let's create a structured plan to clean up the codebase:

1. Dead Code Removal Remove unused components, functions, and imports Clean up any commented-out code blocks Remove any
   leftover non-neumorphic components that have been replaced
2. Configuration Centralization Create a central config file for neumorphic styling variables Extract hardcoded values
   (colors, dimensions, shadows) to this config Ensure theme consistency by referencing these values
3. Code Organization Standardize import ordering across files Ensure consistent component structure Clean up any
   duplicate logic or redundant code
4. Performance Optimization Check for unnecessary re-renders Review and optimize any heavy operations Consider code
   splitting for larger components
